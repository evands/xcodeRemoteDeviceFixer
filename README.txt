This SIMBL bundle prevents XCode 4.1 and earlier from trying to access an iOS device running iOS 5.0 (or later) with WiFi Syncing enabled.  It therefore works around a bug in which CPU consumption goes to 11 in that setting.

It'll warn you that it's not being loaded in XCode 4.2.  That's fine; just click OK.

It depends upon SIMBL.  Install it from http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php

The bundle itself, like any SIMBL bundle, installs to ~/Library/Application\ Support/SIMBL/Plugins
